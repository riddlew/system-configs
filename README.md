### Gundo
[Link to gundo](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/gundo)

Adds branched undo history. If you undo something and then make changes, you can no longer get back to that first change before you undid it. This allows you to get back to any change you made in the past.

Ex: I type "gunda". I undo and correct spelling to "gundo". You can't undo back to "gunda". With this plugin, you can.
